Weather Data Analysis

Overview

This project is part of my Data Analysis Internship at BistartX, focusing on analyzing multi-year weather trends using Python. The analysis covers temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, visibility, and wind bearing variations across different seasons.

Data Sources

The dataset consists of recorded weather conditions across multiple years.

Includes features like Temperature (C), Humidity (%), Pressure (millibars), Wind Speed (km/h), Visibility (km), and Wind Bearing (degrees).

Key Findings

1️⃣ Temperature Trends

Summer peaks above 20°C, while Winter drops significantly, sometimes below 0°C.

Fall and Spring exhibit moderate and stable temperatures.

2️⃣ Humidity Patterns

Winter has the highest humidity (~90%), while Summer has the lowest (~55-60%).

Humidity decreases from Fall to Summer and increases again in Winter.

3️⃣ Pressure Variations

Winter records the highest pressure (~1024 millibars), while Spring has the lowest.

Seasonal fluctuations indicate potential weather instability.

4️⃣ Wind Speed Insights

Spring and Winter experience higher wind speeds, crucial for wind energy assessments.

Summer has the lowest wind speeds, making it more stable for outdoor activities.

5️⃣ Visibility Trends

Spring and Summer have the best visibility (~14 km).

Winter and Fall show reduced visibility due to fog or precipitation effects.

6️⃣ Wind Bearing Trends

Significant seasonal variations in wind bearing values.

Summer peaks at ~200°, while Winter fluctuates more significantly.

Tools & Technologies Used

✅ Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib) – Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
✅ Power BI – Interactive data exploration and dashboards.
✅ SQL – Querying and filtering datasets.

Business Impact & Recommendations

🔹 Energy Planning: Adjust heating/cooling strategies based on seasonal variations.
🔹 Agriculture: Optimize planting schedules and introduce frost protection in Winter.
🔹 Climate Monitoring: Track anomalies and assess long-term weather trends.
🔹 Tourism & Outdoor Activities: Plan events around stable seasonal weather conditions.

Next Steps
Further analysis on extreme weather events and anomalies.
Advanced modeling for predictive weather analysis.
Integration with real-time weather API for continuous monitoring.
